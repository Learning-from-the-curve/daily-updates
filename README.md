# Overview
This repo contains all codes to produce the daily updates reports at [Learning from the curve](https://learning-from-the-curve.github.io).

Codes are written by [Federico Gallina](https://github.com/FedeGall) and [Glenn Magerman](https://github.com/glennmagerman).

We provide 2 parallel sets of code: one for Python and one for Stata.
Both codes produce the same results for the final report, except that the graphs are not interactive in the Stata version.
If you find errors, or want to contribute, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/Learning-from-the-curve/daily-updates/issues). If you want to use the codes, you can clone the repo.
